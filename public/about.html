    <p><strong>The capital city of Ilocos Sur, Vigan City, considered one of the best-preserved Spanish colonial towns
        in Asia. Since the 16th century, it has maintained its authentic grid street plan, with cobblestone streets
        lined with ancestral houses and colonial buildings that showcase illustrious Spanish architecture and design
        influences from old Europe and China — earning its accolades of being a UNESCO World Heritage Site and one of
        the New7Wonders Cities.</p>

    <p>Despite its growing modernization, Vigan City’s old-world charm remains: stone houses with red tile roofs and
      capiz shell windows dot the entire townscape, fronted by stalls selling handicrafts such as the region’s
      traditional woven fabric and hand-made pottery, while horse-drawn carriages called kalesas fill the air with their
      clattering sound. At night, the dynamic street action suddenly transforms into a romantic tranquility with
      overhead lamps lighting the structures and pavements.</strong></p>
